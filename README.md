NinjaMods
==================

The giant (not yet) heap of all my mods.

That includes:

SteamTech - The mod that shall revelutionize the use of steam.
Will be using Railcraft as a dependency until further decided.

OpenRecipes - Where recipes become easier and logical

NinjaOres - Ores, ores, and ores.  Did I mention ores?  Ore gen for all my mods.

OpenStructures - Readding adventure to Minecraft by adding more structure gen.

NinjaAPI - A WIP API that will handle everything for my mods and yours too.  As of right now, only has additonal config rules.

More to come as I create them.

If you would like to help write my mods, message me and I will add you as a contibuter.

Rules for contributers:

Make your own branch.

If you made something that you want in the mod, make a pull request.
